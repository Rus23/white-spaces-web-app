Our goal is to provide you with a healthy and functional base that you can upgrade further. That means – we reorganize, repurpose and suggest improved layouts according to apartment potential and your preferences, of course. At the moment, however, we do not offer interior design services.

Still, there is something we can do for you in that field. We listed a few platforms and apps that can come in handy. 
     
  - Houzz app for Android users lets you browse interior design photos for inspiration, buy products, hire professional help, and much more! You can also download Houzz app in the App Store.

  - If you prefer online platforms, we suggest Modsy (treba ulinkati ime sa vebsajtom They are budget-friendly and offer a clean UI. Get a 3D redesign with furniture made by famous retailers!

  - For clients with a higher price range in search of a home design website, we offer Decorist. They match you with an architect to help you redecorate.

    'Our policy is to involve the client in the process so the outcome is successful. Therefore, we don’t provide official revisions after the final project, but rather opt for corrections along the way. For some projects, depending on the needs, there won’t be any changes, but for others, there will be multiple corrections. With your involvement, the end project should be the best solution for you and your place.'

    'Can I get the necessary licenses in my own country with this project?',
    'Every country has different laws and standards. If your country requires licenses for this kind of intervention then you will need to contact a local architectural bureau or a contractor to adjust, or just simply sign the project with the local work permit. In turn, we will send you all AutoCAD sourced files to minimize their engagement.'

    'What do I get within the kitchen renovation add-on plan?',

    'Do I need add-ons besides the basic package?',
    `Once you take care of the lighting, kitchen, and storage room, the renovation process is nearly done. Since these add-ons wrap up the whole project, we always encourage you to think about them. The last step would be the furniture selection and adding a few finishing touches. 
Plus, closet plans drawings are sometimes crucial for small apartments because they can maximize the space.

    'What if I don’t have the blueprints of my apartment?',
    `
We must have your original floor plan drawing to get started. The blueprints are essential for many reasons
If you do not own the blueprints, we suggest you use an app or an online platform to help you draw one. If you don’t feel confident to use apps and platforms, you can draw the floor plan yourself. Most of the work comes down to measuring your apartment – walls and floors etc.

If you opt for platforms, we suggest the Magicplan.app. The interface is clear and user-friendly. You only need to write the correct dimensions. And you can get the blueprint in no time.
    
Feel free to contact us directly via hi@whitespacerenovation.com and we will walk you through the required steps and take it from there once you purchase the package.
